        <font size="6px" face="cursive">What is Data Structure and Algorithm?</font><br>
        <font size="2px" face="Arial">Since its release in 1995, the Java programming language has grown in popularity.
             This powerful programming language is used in many industries for creating software applications. <br><br>
            This post will discuss what Java is, its history, and the industries that use it. Finally, 
            we will wrap up by looking at a couple of brief code examples in the Java programming language.</font>

            <font size="2px" face="Arial">You may already know that computers are used to store and modify massive amounts of data. Data structures are used to efficiently and conveniently arrange and store data. <br><br>

                Organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used effectively is known as a data structure. In addition to defining the relationships between data pieces, it offers a means of representing and storing data. Common data structures include trees, stacks, queues, linked lists, arrays, and stacks.<br><br>
                
                Now, an algorithm is a set of guidelines or procedures used to complete a task or solve a problem. To get a certain outcome, algorithms are used to alter data that is stored in data structures. Data in an array or linked list can be sorted using a sorting algorithm, for instance.<br><br>
                
                Data structures and algorithms are closely associated in computer science because an algorithm’s effectiveness frequently depends on the selection of an effective data structure. An algorithm can become more effective and quick with the right data format. For instance, a hash table is a popular data structure for quick data retrieval and searching.<br><br>
                
                It is impossible to emphasize the significance of data structures and algorithms in computer science. Writing effective computer programs requires an understanding of these fundamental ideas, which serve as the cornerstone of software development.<br><br>
                
                For example, suppose you are creating software to look for a specific name in a large client database. Your program’s effectiveness will be influenced by the algorithm and data format you choose. Your software could take a long time to finish the search if you pick a poor data structure or technique. Yet, your program will run more quickly and efficiently if you select an effective data structure and algorithm.<br><br>
