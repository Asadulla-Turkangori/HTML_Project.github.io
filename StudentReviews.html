                It was good experience with the tap academy, i have learned coding from the scratch with 
                the zero knowledge i had but now i know the basics of the web programming languages, it 
                was very helpful for me to add to my resume as well. Thanks to Rohit sir who is the best 
                Trainer i have came across and also Megha mam and everyone from the Tap academy who helped 
                in this training. It's a great journey till now and i want to be perfect in this before the 
                completion of the course.
